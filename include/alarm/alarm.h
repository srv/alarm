 * This node subscribes to different topics which values can indicate a hazardous situation inside the
 * cilinder. Today only the humidity value given by the humidity sensors is controlled to
 * see if there is water inside the cilinder. If there is, the Pc is switched off.
 * In the same way, other points can be controlled, such as if the battery if off. 
 * The status of the alarm is continuously published at low freq√ºency in the tpic emergency_alarm, which must be periodically checked.
